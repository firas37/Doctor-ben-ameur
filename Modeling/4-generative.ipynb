      " Answer: Hello, It is a typical feature of fungal infection (also known as tinea cruris or jock itch). As of now clean the area with soap and water and apply antifungal like clotrimazole for symptomatic relief. An antihistamine like cetrezine can be taken for itching. Good personal hygiene is also important. Generally, the symptoms will settle in a few days. If lesion persists better to consult a dermatologist and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician\n",

      "Question: What can cause constant itching around groin area?\n",
      " Answer: Hello, It is a typical feature of fungal infection (also known as tinea cruris or jock itch). As of now clean the area with soap and water and apply antifungal like clotrimazole for symptomatic relief. An antihistamine like cetrezine can be taken for itching. Good personal hygiene is also important. Generally, the symptoms will settle in a few days. If lesion persists better to consult a dermatologist and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician\n",
